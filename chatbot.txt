Data science is a discipline that combines math, statistics, artificial intelligence and computer science to process large volumes of data and determine patterns and trends. 
With these insights, organizations can better understand why certain events happen and develop more informed decision-making processes.
Data science is the realm of data scientists, who often rely on artificial intelligence, especially its subfields of machine learning and deep learning, to create models and make predictions using algorithms and other techniques. 
Data science makes it possible to analyze large amounts of data and spot trends through formats like data visualizations and predictive models. Given the ability to take proactive measures, businesses can then make smarter decisions, design more efficient operations, improve their cybersecurity practices and provide better customer experiences as a result.
Teams are already applying data science across a range of scenarios like diagnosing diseases, detecting malware and optimizing transportation routes.
